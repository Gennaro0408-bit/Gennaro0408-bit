### Hi there, I'm an Engineering Student! 👋🇮🇹

I am passionate about **Mathematics, Optimization, and Problem Solving**.
Currently, I am diving deep into Calculus II and preparing for my journey to **City University of Hong Kong (CityU)** 🇭🇰.

---

### 🛠️ What I'm working on
- 🔭 **Advanced Calculus:** Mastering Hessian Matrices and Optimization strategies.
- 🐍 **Python for Math:** Building tools to automate complex calculations (check out my [Hessian Solver](https://github.com/TuoUsername/hessian-matrix-solver)).
- 🌏 **Global Mindset:** Getting ready for an international exchange experience.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I can calculate a determinant faster than I can cook pasta (and I'm Italian, so that says a lot).
